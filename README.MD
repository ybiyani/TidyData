Project 

====================
title: "ReadMe for TidyData Project"
output: html_document
------------------

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

The output was to create a R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
-Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
-Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
-Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
-Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
-From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```
